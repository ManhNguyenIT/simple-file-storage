# System Patterns

## How the system is built

This project is built using Next.js, a React-based framework for server-side rendered applications. The system follows a standard Next.js project structure with API routes for handling server-side logic.

## Key technical decisions

- Using Next.js API routes for file operations
- Storing files in the `public/assets/` directory for easy access
- Implementing server-side file handling to ensure security and proper file management
- Using TypeScript for type safety and better development experience

## Architecture patterns

- Server-side API routes for file upload, listing, and download
- Client-side React components for the user interface
- Separation of concerns between UI and API logic
- Using Next.js file system API for file operations
